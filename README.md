# neural-multiplexing
This repository includes R codes for analyzing single neuron multiplexing in response to two stimuli. Main codes are in dynamic_neural_model.R. The `fitter.fn' is the main wrapper function needed to run analysis on real data.

'neuro_exp.R' contains codes for creating, analyzing and summarizing synthetic data

'neuro_real.R' contains codes for creating, analyzing and summarizing real data
